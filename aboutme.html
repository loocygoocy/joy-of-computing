    <p class="b">I play golf with my dad all the time. I figured I would try out for the golf team just to see how it was. I had no idea what to expect going inyo tryouts. Then I made varsity and got the second best score out of everyone who tried out! Then I quit because I had way too much on my plate. I still play golf with my dad sometimes and I might tryout again next year. </p>	

    <h2>my favorite art project</h2>

    <p class="b">I have never been very good at art. I have always doubted myself and thought I was more of a math kinda person. But I worked really hard on this project and I really like how it turned out. I gave it to my parents for christmas.</p>	

    <h2>summer lab</h2>

    <p class="b">My dad is an immunologist professor at Cal. I like science so I am going to work in his lab this summer for fun! The picture above it his lab on their yearly picnic in 2012. I am the little girl on the right and my sister is on the left. </p>

    <p class="b">I love reading but I am a really slow reader. I have a lot of books to read. I am currently reading Where The Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens. I am planning to finish these books and more over the summer. </p>
