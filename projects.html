    	<h2> Semester 1 Game</h2>
    	<p>Last semester I made a game in snap. It is called Log Jump. The goal of the game is to jump over logs and collect cherries. If you hit a log you lose 20 points. If you collect a cherry you get 50 points, you need 100 points to win. I worked really hard on this project. Here are some photos. </p>

    	  <h2>This Website</h2>
    	  <p>I made this website for my freshman computers class. I made it on HTML and CSS. I have really enjoyed making and customizing this website and I think it will help me in the future. Some of my code is below!</p>
